# NeuroMorpho-Access-Tools
A set of Python codes and examples that can be used to easily access and obtain information from the NeuroMorpho database.

From the NeuroMorpho website:
> NeuroMorpho.Org is a centrally curated inventory of digitally reconstructed neurons and glia associated with peer-reviewed publications. It contains contributions from over 800 laboratories worldwide and is continuously updated as new morphological reconstructions are collected, published, and shared. To date, NeuroMorpho.Org is the largest collection of publicly accessible 3D neuronal reconstructions and associated metadata. 

In order for a user to download neuron data from the NeuroMorpho.Org it requiers him to be familiar with the Application Programing Interface (API). The aim of this project is to make the access to NeuroMorpho easier for researchers who do not posses enough programing knowledge through premade Python codes and examples. 
These include codes for API access, cell query and acqusition, data curration and merdging, as well different examples on data exploration and plotting.
