# NeuroMorpho-Access-Tool

NeuroMorpho Access Tool (NMAT) is a simple GUI based on Python which is used to access, find and obtain cells from the NeuroMorpho.Org database. The first version of the program allows researchers to easily find cells and generate a .csv file with their morphometric properties based on three main query criteria (Brain Region, Species, Cell Type). Due to its multithreading structure NMAT is capable of downloading large number of cells in a short time period. 
Additional options include downloading .png image files of cell reconstructions.
